# Advent of Code 2022

Also my attempt to practise writing some idiomatic Go.

## Goals

1. Be as idiomatic as possible
2. Ensure decent test coverage with unit tests
3. Automate as much as possible, from input parsing to test suite running

# Non-goals

1. Solve problems as fast as possible (I'd LeetCode for that instead)
2. Unnecessary performance optimizations

I think the overall goal is to make a beautiful sculpture that's art, rather 
than a crude but functional piece of furniture.

At least that's what I am aiming to do, whether it turns out to be is up for
debate...
