Also my attempt to practise writing some idiomatic Go.

## Goals

1. Be as idiomatic as possible
2. Ensure decent test coverage with unit tests
3. Automate as much as possible, from input parsing to test suite running

## Non-goals

1. Solve problems as fast as possible (I'd LeetCode for that instead)
2. Unnecessary performance optimizations
